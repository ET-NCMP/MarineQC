The trackqc module contains a set of functions for performing the tracking QC
first described in Atkinson et al. [2013]. The general procedures described 
in Atkinson et al. [2013] were later revised and improved for the SST CCI 2 project.
Documentation and IDL code for the revised (and original) procedures can be found 
in the CMA FCM code repository. The code in this module represents a port of the
revised IDL code into the python marine QC suite.

These functions perform tracking QC checks on collections of :class:`.MarineReport` 
taken from :class:`.Voyage`

    Check to see whether a drifter has run aground based on 1/100th degree precision positions.

    Positional errors introduced by lon/lat 'jitter' and data precision can be of order several km's.
    Longitude and latitude timeseries are smoothed prior to assessment to reduce position 'jitter'. 
    Some post-smoothing position 'jitter' may remain and its expected magnitude is set within the 
    function by the 'tolerance' parameter. A drifter is deemed aground when, after a period of time, 
    the distance between reports is less than the 'tolerance'. The minimum period of time over which this 
    assessment is made is set by 'min_win_period'. This period must be long enough such that slow moving 
    drifters are not falsely flagged as aground given errors in position (e.g. a buoy drifting at around 
    1 cm/s will travel around 1 km/day; given 'tolerance' and precision errors of a few km's the 'min_win_period'
    needs to be several days to ensure distance-travelled exceeds the error so that motion is reliably 
    detected and the buoy is not falsely flagged as aground). However, min_win_period should not be longer

    precision positions. A flag 'drf_spd' is set for each input report: flag=1 for reports deemed picked up, 
    else flag=0.

    A drifter is deemed picked up if it is moving faster than might be expected for a fast ocean current
    (a few m/s). Unreasonably fast movement is detected when speed of travel between report-pairs exceeds
    the chosen 'speed_limit' (speed is estimated as distance between reports divided by time separation - 
    this 'straight line' speed between the two points is a minimum speed estimate given a less-direct
    path may have been followed). Positional errors introduced by lon/lat 'jitter' and data precision 
    can be of order several km's. Reports must be separated by a suitably long period of time (the 'min_win_period') 
    to minimise the effect of these errors when calculating speed e.g. for reports separated by 24 hours
    errors of several cm/s would result which are two orders of magnitude less than a fast ocean current
    which seems reasonable. Conversley, the period of time chosen should not be too long so as to resolve 
    short-lived burst of speed on manouvering ships. Because temporal sampling can be erratic the time period 
    over which this assessment is made is specified as a range (bound by 'min_win_period' and 'max_win_period')
    - assesment uses the longest time separation available within this range.

    IMPORTANT - for optimal performance, drifter records with observations failing this check should be
    subsequently manually reviewed. Ships move around in all sorts of complicated ways that can readily
    confuse such a simple check (e.g. pausing at sea, crisscrossing its own path) and once some erroneous 
    movement is detected it is likely a human operator can then better pick out the actual bad data.

    Check to see whether a drifter has been picked up by a ship (out of water) based on 1/100th degree 
    precision positions. A flag 'drf_spd' is set for each input report: flag=1 for reports deemed picked up, 
    else flag=0.
    
    A drifter is deemed picked up if it is moving faster than might be expected for a fast ocean current
    (a few m/s). Unreasonably fast movement is detected when speed of travel between report-pairs exceeds
    the chosen 'speed_limit' (speed is estimated as distance between reports divided by time separation - 
    this 'straight line' speed between the two points is a minimum speed estimate given a less-direct
    path may have been followed). Positional errors introduced by lon/lat 'jitter' and data precision 
    can be of order several km's. Reports must be separated by a suitably long period of time (the 'min_win_period') 
    to minimise the effect of these errors when calculating speed e.g. for reports separated by 24 hours
    errors of several cm/s would result which are two orders of magnitude less than a fast ocean current
    which seems reasonable. Conversley, the period of time chosen should not be too long so as to resolve 
    short-lived burst of speed on manouvering ships. For each report, speed is assessed over the shortest 
    available period that exceeds 'min_win_period'.
    
    Prior to assessment the drifter record is screened for positional errors using the iQuam track check
    method (from :class:`.Voyage`). When running the iQuam check the record is treated as a ship (not a
    drifter) so as to avoid accidentally filtering out observations made aboard a ship (which is what we 
    are trying to detect). This iQuam track check does not overwrite any existing iQuam track check flags. 

    IMPORTANT - for optimal performance, drifter records with observations failing this check should be
    subsequently manually reviewed. Ships move around in all sorts of complicated ways that can readily
    confuse such a simple check (e.g. pausing at sea, crisscrossing its own path) and once some erroneous 
    movement is detected it is likely a human operator can then better pick out the actual bad data.

    Check to see whether there is erroneous sea surface temperature data at the beginning or end of a drifter record
    (referred to as 'tails'). The flags 'drf_tail1' and 'drf_tail2' are set for each input report: flag=1 for reports
    with erroneous data, else flag=0, 'drf_tail1' is used for bad data at the beginning of a record, 'drf_tail2' is
    used for bad data at the end of a record.

    The tail check makes an assessment of the quality of data at the start and end of a drifting buoy record by
    comparing to a background reference field. Data found to be unacceptably biased or noisy relative to the
    background are flagged by the check. When making the comparison an allowance is made for background error
    variance and also normal drifter error (both bias and random measurement error). The correlation of the
    background error is treated as unknown and takes on a value which maximises background error dependent on the
    assesment being made. A background error variance limit is also specified, beyond which the background is deemed
    unreliable. Observations made during the day, in icy regions or where the background value is missing are
    excluded from the comparison.

    The check proceeds in two steps; a 'long tail-check' followed by a 'short tail-check'. The idea is that the short
    tail-check has finer resolution but lower sensitivity than the long tail-check and may pick off noisy data not
    picked up by the long tail check. Only observations that pass the long tail-check are passed to the short
    tail-check. Both of these tail checks proceed by moving a window over the data and assessing the data in each
    window. Once good data are found the check stops and any bad data preceeding this are flagged. If unreliable
    background data are encountered the check stops. The checks are run forwards and backwards over the record so as
    to assess data at the start and end of the record. If the whole record fails no observations are flagged as there
    are then no 'tails' in the data (this is left for other checks). The long tail check looks for groups of
    observations that are too biased or noisy as a whole. The short tail check looks for individual observations
    exceeding a noise limit within the window.

    Check to see whether a drifter sea surface temperature record is unacceptably biased or noisy as a whole.  

    The check makes an assessment of the quality of data in a drifting buoy record by comparing to a background
    reference field. If the record is found to be unacceptably biased or noisy relative to the background all
    observations are flagged by the check. For longer records the flags 'drf_bias' and 'drf_noise' are set for each
    input report: flag=1 for records with erroneous data, else flag=0. For shorter records 'drf_short' is set for
    each input report: flag=1 for reports with erroneous data, else flag=0.

    When making the comparison an allowance is made for background error variance and also normal drifter error (both
    bias and random measurement error). A background error variance limit is also specified, beyond which the
    background is deemed unreliable and is excluded from comparison. Observations made during the day, in icy regions
    or where the background value is missing are also excluded from the comparison.

    The check has two separate streams; a 'long-record check' and a 'short-record check'. Records with at least
    n_eval observations are passed to the long-record check, else they are passed to the short-record check. The
    long-record check looks for records that are too biased or noisy as a whole. The short record check looks for
    individual observations exceeding a noise limit within a record. The purpose of n_eval is to ensure records with
    too few observations for their bias and noise to be reliably estimated are handled separately by the short-record
    check.
 
    The correlation of the background error is treated as unknown and handled differently for each assessment. For
    the long-record noise-check and the short-record check the background error is treated as uncorrelated,
    which maximises the possible impact of background error on these assessments. For the long-record bias-check a
    limit (bias_lim) is specified beyond which the record is considered biased. The default value for this limit was
    chosen based on histograms of drifter-background bias. An alternative approach would be to treat the background
    error as entirely correlated across a long-record, which maximises its possible impact on the bias assessment. In
    this case the histogram approach was used as the limit could be tuned to give better results.
